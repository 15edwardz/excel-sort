# excel-sort
A python program that I wrote to sort a personal excel project of a relative, tailored for a specific format. 
Added an example sheets saved as csv files for the program.
Finds the duplicate names and checks if the values are the same. If the values aren't the same, they are outputted into the duplicates.csv file
